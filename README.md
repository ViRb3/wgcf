## Features
- Register new account
- Change license key to use existing Warp+ subscription
- Generate WireGuard profile
- Check account status
- Print trace information to debug Warp/Warp+ status

## Download
You can find pre-compiled binaries on the [releases page](https://github.com/ViRb3/wgcf/releases).

## Usage
Run `wgcf` in a terminal without any arguments to display the help screen. All commands and parameters are documented.

### Register new account
Run the following command in a terminal:
```bash
wgcf register
```
The new account will be saved under `wgcf-account.toml`

### Generate WireGuard profile
Run the following command in a terminal:
```bash
wgcf generate
```
The WireGuard profile will be saved under `wgcf-profile.conf`. For more information on how to use it, please check the official [WireGuard Quick Start](https://www.wireguard.com/quickstart/).

#### Maximum transmission unit (MTU)
To ensure maximum compatibility, the generated profile will have a MTU of 1280, just like the official Android app. If you are experiencing performance issues, you may be able to improve your speed by increasing this value. For more information, please check [#40](https://github.com/ViRb3/wgcf/issues/40).

### Add a license key
If you have an existing Warp+ subscription, for example on your phone, you can bind the account generated by this tool to your phone's account, sharing its Warp+ status. Please note that there is a current limit of maximum of 5 linked devices active at a time. 

First, get your Warp+ account license key. To view it on Android:
1. Open the `1.1.1.1` app
2. Click on the hamburger menu button on the top-right corner 
3. Navigate to: `Account` > `Key`

> :warning: You have to add the license key before the very first time of update, [because we won't update your private key as a workaround to make ipv6 survive](https://github.com/ViRb3/wgcf/pull/355)!
> 
> if you had run any `wgcf update` command before adding a license key, **re-register a new account then retry these steps**
 
Create a `wgcf-account.toml` directly with `wgcf register`, **then add the new license key to this file** and run:

```bash
wgcf update
wgcf generate
```

The license will be applied, and a new WARP+ private key will be created for your account.


### Check device status
Run the following command in a terminal:
```bash
wgcf status
```

### Verify Warp/Warp+ works
Connect to the WireGuard profile [generated](#generate-wireguard-profile) by this tool, then run:
```bash
wgcf trace
```
If you look at the last line, it should say `warp=on` or `warp=plus`, depending on whether you have Warp or Warp+ respectively.

## Development
### Sub-packages
- [api_tests](api_tests/main.go) - Tests for API documentation generation
- [spec_format](spec_format/main.go) - OpenAPI3 specification formatter to post-process the spec generated by Optic
### API
This project uses [Optic](https://github.com/opticdev/optic) to automatically generate API documentation using the tests defined in [api_tests](api_tests/main.go). These tests cover all endpoints used by wgcf. The documentation is exported as an OpenAPI3 [specification](openapi-spec.json), which is then used with [openapi-generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/) to generate the Go client API code under [wgcf/openapi](openapi/client.go).

To update the API documentation, [install Optic](https://github.com/opticdev/optic/releases/latest), then run:
```bash
api start
```
Resolve and save all the differences in the Web UI.

To regenerate the Go client API code, [install openapi-generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/installation), then run:
```bash
bash generate-api.sh
```
This script supports both Linux and WSL.
