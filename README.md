# Warp VPN + AdGuard DNS

This project is a fork of the WGCF unofficial CloudFlare Warp CLI, which was created by [ViRb3](https://github.com/ViRb3). The original code is available under the MIT License. I have modified the code to change the default DNS server from 1.1.1.1 to 94.140.14.14. All credit for the original software goes to the creators of WGCF. This means, that the exported .config file, will use AdGuards DNS, which will block ads, but it will still use the Warp VPN. For easy instuctions, read [The Guide here](https://github.com/yodaluca23/Warp-VPN-AdGuard-DNS/blob/master/Guide.md).

## Features
- Register new account
- Change license key to use existing Warp+ subscription
- Generate WireGuard profile
- Check account status
- Print trace information to debug Warp/Warp+ status

## Download
You can find pre-compiled binaries on the [releases page](https://github.com/yodaluca23/Warp-VPN-AdGuard-DNS/releases).

## Usage
Run `wgcf` in a terminal without any arguments to display the help screen. All commands and parameters are documented.

### Register new account
Run the following command in a terminal:
```bash
wgcf register
```
The new account will be saved under `wgcf-account.toml`

### Generate WireGuard profile
Run the following command in a terminal:
```bash
wgcf generate
```
The WireGuard profile will be saved under `wgcf-profile.conf`. For more information on how to use it, please check the official [WireGuard Quick Start](https://www.wireguard.com/quickstart/).

#### Maximum transmission unit (MTU)
To ensure maximum compatibility, the generated profile will have a MTU of 1280, just like the official Android app. If you are experiencing performance issues, you may be able to improve your speed by increasing this value. For more information, please check [#40](https://github.com/ViRb3/wgcf/issues/40).

### Change license key
If you have an existing Warp+ subscription, for an example on your phone, you can bind the account generated by this tool to your phone's account, sharing its Warp+ status. Please note that there is a current limit of maximum 5 linked devices active at a time. 

> :warning: This device's private key will be changed!

First, get your Warp+ account license key. To view it on Android:
1. Open the `1.1.1.1` app
2. Click on the hamburger menu button on the top-right corner
3. Navigate to: `Account` > `Key`

Edit `wgcf-account.toml` directly with the new license key and run:
```bash
wgcf update
```
or, using an environment variable:
```bash
WGCF_LICENSE_KEY="123412341234" wgcf update
```
The license will be applied, and a new private key will be created for your account. [Regenerate](#generate-wireguard-profile) your WireGuard configuration and use the new private key.


### Check device status
Run the following command in a terminal:
```bash
wgcf status
```

### Verify Warp/Warp+ works
Connect to the WireGuard profile [generated](#generate-wireguard-profile) by this tool, then run:
```bash
wgcf trace
```
If you look at the last line, it should say `warp=on` or `warp=plus`, depending on whether you have Warp or Warp+ respectively.

## Development
### Sub-packages
- [api_tests](api_tests/main.go) - Tests for API documentation generation
- [spec_format](spec_format/main.go) - OpenAPI3 specification formatter to post-process the spec generated by Optic
### API
This project uses [Optic](https://github.com/opticdev/optic) to automatically generate API documentation using the tests defined in [api_tests](api_tests/main.go). These tests cover all endpoints used by wgcf. The documentation is exported as an OpenAPI3 [specification](openapi-spec.json), which is then used with [openapi-generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/) to generate the Go client API code under [wgcf/openapi](openapi/client.go).

To update the API documentation, [install Optic](https://github.com/opticdev/optic/releases/latest), then run:
```bash
api start
```
Resolve and save all the differences in the Web UI.

To regenerate the Go client API code, [install openapi-generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/installation), then run:
```bash
bash generate-api.sh
```
This script supports both Linux and WSL.
